                "description": "This video explains the 369 Theory of Tesla also called as Tesla Code 369. The 3 6 9 theory by Nikola Tesla explains the secret code of the universe, which can be used to understand the mysteries of the universe. The video also explains how to find digital root of a number. (Digital root method). \nAfter watching the video, you will understand how our whole universe is controlled by numbers 3, 6 and 9 and how they are present everywhere in the universe.\nYou will also know how the numbers 3, 6, 9 represent a higher dimensional world while rest of the numbers belong to our three-dimensional world.\nI will also discuss, how number 9 is the controller of all the other numbers and how it can control even space and time?\nNikola Tesla, the greatest mind of all the time and also a man of mysteries said that- if you knew the magnificence of 3, 6 and 9, you would have a key to the universe !\nHad he found some code of the universe?\nHere I will provide many mathematical and physical evidences and examples to prove, how the number 9 is present everywhere and is the controller of all the other numbers and the universe.\nOur universe is so mathematical, almost everything in nature is highly symmetrical and follows geometrical patterns. We can see these patterns in the form of golden ratio and Fibonacci sequence present in many things in nature.\nEverything is made up of particles and if we go deeper at even more microscopic level, we reach into the quantum world, which is pure mathematics.\nAll the Living things in this world are made up of cells. Multicellular organisms are formed by the division of a single cell. A single cell divides into 2 cells, then after division of both the cells we get 4 cells, then 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 cells are produced. In this way the doubling sequence continues and finally we have a full multicellular organism.\nAccording to some researchers, numbers- 1, 2, 4, 8, 7 and 5 represent our three dimensional world where we live in while numbers 3 6 9  belong to a higher dimensional world.\nWhether we double or half the numbers, if we start with number 3, we get numbers 3 and 6 only.\nEven if we double or half the numbers starting from number 6, we will get the same numbers 3 and 6 every time. But surprisingly even this time 9 is absent in the sequence. \nActually number 9 controls the numbers 3 and 6. And numbers 1, 2, 4 are controlled by number 3\nWhile numbers 8, 7 and 5 are controlled by number 6. In this way number 9 controls all the numbers.\nWhether we double or half the numbers, starting from the number 9, we always get the number 9 only. It Implies that number 9 represents itself! Number 9 is present everywhere in the universe!\nwhen we were dividing the circle in half repeatedly, we were reaching the singularity of space. Since every time we got number 9, it means number 9 follows the space up to its singularity.\nAnd when we were increasing the number of sides of the polygon, the polygon was looking like a circle. As the number of sides of the polygon approaches infinity it becomes a circle. As in all the polygons we got number 9, it means number 9 also follows space upto infinity.\nSo it is clear that number 9 is present from singularity of space to the Infinity of space.\nNow I will give you some more examples, that will help you in believing that number 9 exists at all the places in the universe.\nspeed of light   186282miles\/sec=1+8+6+2+8+2=27=2+7=9\nDiameter of the earth   7920 miles= 7+9+2+0=18=1+8=9 \nDiameter of the Sun  864000 miles= 8+6+4+0+0+0=18=1+8=9\nDiameter of the Moon     2160 miles= 2+1+6+0=9\nNumber of planets in our solar system= 9 (controversial)\nDoes number 9 has any relationship with time also? (They all reduce to 9)\nSeconds in one hour 3600\nseconds in a day 86400\nseconds in a week 604800\nseconds in a month 2592000\nSeconds in a year 31536000\nMinutes in a day 1440\nMinutes in a week 10080\nMinutes in a month 43200\nMinutes in a year 525600\nand so on...\nBonus example:\nTotal Duration of pregnancy - 9 months\nIt proves that number 9 is present everywhere in space and time and also controls it.\nIf we talk about Hindu religion, we will find number 9 at different places. like in Om frequency 432 hz and its shape. In 108 sacred number etc.\nNumber 9 represents everything and also nothingness.\nActually number 9 is same as Number 0 in some sense.\nOne more thing, As we get 0 on multiplying any number by 0. In the same way we get number 9 as the digital root on multiplying it with number 9.\n0=9\nIf we add all the numbers except number 9, that is from number 1 to number 8; the sum reduces to number 9\n1 + 2 + 3 +   = 36 = 9\nHence we can say that, number 9 represents all the other numbers. It represents itself and also nothingness and everything!!! Number 9 is the king of all the numbers that controls all the other numbers and space time..",
